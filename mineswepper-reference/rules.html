    <p><span class="highlight">Objective:</span> Uncover all cells that do not contain mines. If you reveal a cell with a mine, you lose the game.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Board Setup:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The board consists of a grid of cells, with a certain number of hidden mines randomly placed.</li>
        <li>The number of mines is predetermined based on the difficulty level.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="highlight">Revealing Cells:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on a cell to reveal what is underneath.</li>
        <li>If the cell contains a mine, the game is over (you lose).</li>
        <li>If the cell does not contain a mine, a number appears indicating how many adjacent cells contain mines.</li>
        <li>If the revealed cell has no adjacent mines (number 0), all adjacent cells are automatically revealed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="highlight">Marking Mines:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can mark a cell as a suspected mine by placing a flag on it.</li>
        <li>Flags help keep track of potential mines, but you do not need to mark all mines to win.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="highlight">Winning:</span> The game is won when all cells that do not contain mines are revealed. Marking all mines correctly with flags is not a requirement for winning, but it can help keep track of dangerous spots.</p>
    <div class="tip">ðŸ’¡ <strong>Gameplay Tip:</strong> Use the numbers on revealed cells to deduce where mines may be and proceed with caution!</div>
